/**
 * Represents an abstract base class for commands used within the system.
 *
 * This class acts as a blueprint for defining commands with attributes such as
 * name, permission, description, aliases, and execution type. It supports a
 * hierarchical structure of commands and subcommands, allowing complex command
 * systems to be implemented effectively.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * - Command metadata such as name, permission, description, and aliases.
 * - Support for different types of command executors (e.g., players, console, or both).
 * - Registration and retrieval of subcommands and arguments.
 * - Execution context management through a command sender and arguments.
 *
 * Subclasses are required to implement the `run` method to define the specific
 * behavior of the command during execution.
